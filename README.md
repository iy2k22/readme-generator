# README Generator
![Generated file](./assets/images/screenshot.png)

This is my solution for the Module 11 Challenge of the edX front-end bootcamp. It's a README Generator that takes input from the user using inquirer and then outputs to a markdown file.

**Table of Contents**:
- [Installation](#install)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)

## Usage
Once you've installed the dependencies, you can use the generator like so:
```bash

Once you've completed the questions, `out.md` should be generated.
